# Minor holdings
Code for a data request from Defra's BSFP team. The June census team within Resas can provide additional data/information to help.

The specifications for the request are:
Split into two groups: those holdings with >= 20ha total crops + grass and those with <20ha total crops + grass.  Grass to exclude rough grazing.  
For each group I would like:
*	Number of holdings
*	Total crop area
*	Total grass area (excluding rough grazing)
*	Total H10 (farmed area)
*	Total sole rights rough grazing area
*	Please provide for 2020, 2021 and 2022.  Please let me know when 2023 would be available from.

Weâ€™re defining all crops and grass as: A99 + B99 + C99 + D99 + F99 + G1 + G2

A = arable (incl fallow)
B = veg
C = fruit
D = ornamentals
F = Glasshouse
G1 = grass <5 years
G2 = grass >5 years
