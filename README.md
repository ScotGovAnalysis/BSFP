# BSFP

Code for a data request from Defra's BSFP team.

The specifications for the request are:
Split into two groups: those holdings with >= 20ha total crops + grass and those with <20ha total crops + grass.  Grass to exclude rough grazing.  
•	For each group I would like:
•	Number of holdings
•	Total crop area
•	Total grass area (excluding rough grazing)
•	Total H10
•	Total sole rights rough grazing area
•	Please provide for 2020, 2021 and 2022.  Please let me know when 2023 would be available from.

We’re defining all crops and grass as: A99 + B99 + C99 + D99 + F99 + G1 + G2

A = arable (incl fallow)
B = veg
C = fruit
D = ornamentals
F = Glasshouse
G1 = grass <5 years
G2 = grass >5 years
