# BSFP

Code for a data request from Defra's BSFP team.

The specifications for the request are:
Find which the river basin district which each farm in the BSFP sample is in.

This can be done using the June census addresses dataset, which contains a grid reference for each farm, and a shapefile with the RBDs.
