# River basin districts

Code for a data request from Defra's BSFP team:
Find which river basin district each Scottish farm in the BSFP sample is in.

This can be done using the June census addresses dataset, which contains a grid reference for each farm, and a shapefile with the RBDs.

For each Scottish holding in the BSFP, identify whether it is in the Solway-Tweed or Rest of Scotland RBD and perform some basic QA.
